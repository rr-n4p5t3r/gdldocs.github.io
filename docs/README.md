# Goldendog Linux Documentation

### Whats is Goldendog Linux?

GoldenDog Linux is a Linux Workstation that aims to be friendly, simple to use and yet provide all the integrity, stability and reliability that a platform like Debian Stable has to offer.

### Why debian?

There were a few reasons why. Primarily because I had been a Debian user for most part of my life, starting around 2004, and had used it as my daily driver up until the year 2019 where I started using Fedora too. These 15 years of experience made me very familiar with how this operating system works.
GoldenDog is not the only work that uses Debian as platform. Many popular systems such as Ubuntu, Mint and Kali use it too. This is because at its core, it's very meticulously planned and maintained, making it an excellent choice for a reliable engine that adapts to almost every case of use.

Debian also encourages derivative works that use their software to use their official mirrors. This is why GoldenDog runs exclusively official debian software and mirrors, taking advantage of the frequent updates and patches that Debian provides, specially since this is a one-woman project that I work on when time allows, and I could not be packaging thousands of .deb packages all by myself on a regular basis, using only official debian packages makes everyone happy.
